# Smart Licenses

## Purpose

Allow content owners to offer, sell and verify content lincenses via blockchain. 
This document specifies multiple streams and the associated  data structures 
and transaction models that can be used to publish and verify  machine readable 
licenses and contracting rules.

## Schema

The SmartLicense protocol uses multiple streams. All streams are readable and 
writable by every blockchain participant. A SmartLicense is identified by a 
publisher provided UUID Version 4. 
See [smartlicense.proto](../smartlicense/smartlicense.proto) for current state 
of data structure for SmartLicenses.

## Streams

- `smartlicense`: the primary stream to publish SmartLicenses
- `smartlicense-attestation`: for publishing license attestations

## Transaction Models

### Attestation Example

This is an example that demostrates attestation based licensing process.

#### Creating an attestion based SmartLicense

A publisher creates a SmartLicense with a frontend application. The 
application then creates an encoded version of the data collected from the 
user. A minimal JSON-encoded SmartLicense looks like this:

```json
{
  	"materials": ["2EvGugzdGh5Zp-2LpzWi7kt2kUA-2LpprH51GMPhq-2VhLRzBEdDLa4"],
  	"activation_modes": ["ON_CHAIN_ATTESTATION"]
}
```

In this example the `licensors` and the `payment_address` fields are not 
explicitly specified. Both will be set  to the **Wallet-ID** of the entity 
that published the SmartLicense to the blockchain. The application also 
generates a **UUID4** as identifier for a specific SmartLicense. The 
application publishes the SmartLicense as a multichain stream-item signed by 
the publisher to the `smartlicense` stream with the **UUID4** as key and the 
SmartLicense as data. The data is published in a compact binary encoding 
(protobuf).

#### Issuing  a License to a user

The publisher registers an entry in the  `smartlicense-attestation` - stream 
with the **Wallet-ID** of the user as key and the **SmartLicense UUID4** as 
data.

#### Verifying a License for a user

Given an ISCC content identifier:

- Ask the user to sign a random nonce with his Wallet-ID
- Lookup the `smartlicense-attestation` stream for SmartLicenses attested to 
the user
- ...

### On-Chain Payment
...

## Validation

The first time given UUID4 is published to the stream as an item-key it is 
considered to be owned by the publishing Wallet-ID(s). Subsequent stream
entries with the same UUID4 key must be ignored if they are signed by a 
different Wallet-ID.
